# 🚀 Real-Time Fraud Detection System

A production-style **Real-Time Fraud Detection System** built using **FastAPI** and **Machine Learning** to classify financial transactions as **FRAUD** or **SAFE** in real time.

This project simulates how banks, fintech companies, and payment gateways detect fraudulent transactions instantly.

---

## 📌 Features

* REST API for transaction ingestion
* Machine Learning–based fraud prediction
* Real-time risk scoring
* Swagger API documentation
* Modular backend architecture
* Fast and lightweight inference

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** FastAPI
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
* **Language:** Python
* **API Documentation:** Swagger (OpenAPI)
* **Model Serialization:** Joblib

## ⚙️ How the System Works

1. A transaction is sent to the API
2. FastAPI validates and processes the request
3. ML model predicts fraud probability
4. Business logic classifies transaction
5. Result is returned instantly

## 📥 API Endpoint

### POST `/transaction`

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "TXN777",
  "amount": 18000,
  "is_international": true,
  "transaction_count_24h": 6
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "transaction_id": "TXN777",
  "risk_score": 1,
  "decision": "FRAUD"
}
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2️⃣ Start the Server

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 3️⃣ Open Swagger UI

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

---

## 🧪 Train the ML Model

```bash
cd ml
python train_model.py
```

This generates `fraud_model.pkl`, which is used by the backend for real-time prediction.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Details

* **Model:** Logistic Regression

* **Features Used:**

  * Transaction amount
  * Number of transactions in last 24 hours
  * International transaction flag

* **Output:** Fraud probability (0–1)

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

* Banking systems
* Fintech applications
* Payment gateways
* E-commerce fraud detection

---

## 🧾 Resume Description

> Built a real-time fraud detection system using FastAPI and machine learning to score live transactions and classify them as fraud or safe with sub-second latency.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Kafka for real-time streaming
* Database integration
* User authentication
* Model retraining pipeline
* Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)
